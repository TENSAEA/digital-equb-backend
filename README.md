# Digital Equb Project

## Introduction

Digital Equb is a modern web platform designed to facilitate collaborative savings and financial management within communities. Inspired by the traditional Ethiopian practice of "Equb," which involves a group of people regularly contributing money to a pool that is then allocated to each member in turn, this digital version streamlines the process, making it more accessible, secure, and manageable.

## Features

- User Management: Secure registration and authentication system for users to access their accounts.

- Equb Creation: Users can create and manage their own Equb groups, setting contribution amounts, frequency, and duration.

- Contribution Tracking: Members can track their contributions and view the status of the collective pool.
- Automated Payouts: The system automatically manages the rotation of payouts to members according to the Equb schedule.

- Notifications: Real-time notifications to keep all members updated on Equb activities and contributions.

- Admin Dashboard: Administrators can oversee user activities, manage disputes, and generate reports.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js with Express for a robust server-side platform.

- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for flexible data storage and retrieval.

- Authentication: JWT for secure token-based user authentication.

- Frontend: React with Redux
